NAME

    CGI::Application::Plugin::TT::LastModified - Set "Last-Modified" header
    based on TT template

SYNOPSIS

      # when you want to set the "Last-Modified" header manually
        use base qw(CGI::Application);
        use CGI::Application::Plugin::TT;
        use CGI::Application::Plugin::TT::LastModified;
    
        sub my_runmode {
            my $self = shift;
            my %params = (
                # ...
                );
            my $html = $self->tt_process( 'template.html', \%params );
            $self->tt_set_last_modified_header();
            return $html;
        }
    
      # when you want the "Last-Modified" header set automatically
        use base qw(CGI::Application);
        use CGI::Application::Plugin::TT;
        use CGI::Application::Plugin::TT::LastModified qw(:auto);
    
        sub my_runmode {
            my $self = shift;
            my %params = (
                # ...
                );
            return $self->tt_process( 'template.html', \%params );
        }

DESCRIPTION

    CGI::Application::Plugin::TT::LastModified adds support to
    CGI::Application for setting a "Last-Modified" header based on the most
    recent modification time of any of the components of a template that
    was processed with TT.

    Normally you'll want to call it manually, on as "as needed" basis; if
    you're processing templates with TT you're most likely dealing with
    dynamic content (in which case you probably don't even want a
    "Last-Modified" header). The odd time you'll want to set a
    "Last-Modified" header, though, this plugin helps make that easier.

    If you have a desire to have the "Last-Modified" header set
    automatically for you, though,
    CGI::Application::Plugin::TT::LastModified does have an :auto import
    tag which auto-registers "tt_set_last_modified_header()" as a
    "tt_post_process" hook for you. If you've got an app that just
    processes static TT pages and generates output, this will be useful for
    you.

METHODS

    import()

      Custom import routine, which allows for tt_set_last_modified_header()
      to be auto-added in as a TT post process hook.

    tt_last_modified()

      Returns the most recent modification time for any component of the
      most recently processed template (via tt_process()). Time is returned
      back to the caller as "the number of seconds since the epoch".

    tt_set_last_modified_header()

      Sets a "Last-Modified" header in the HTTP response, equivalent to the
      last modification time of the template components as returned by
      tt_last_modified().
